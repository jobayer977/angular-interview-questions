1. ### Difference between Angular and AngularJS

Difference between the AngularJS & Angular: Although, there are significant key differences between Angular JS & Angular:

| AngularJS                                     | Angular                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It supports the Model-View-Controller design. | It uses components and directives. Components are the directives with a template. |
| Written in JavaScript                         | Written in TypeScript                                                             |
| Not a mobile friendly framework               | Angular is supported by all the popular mobile browsers.                          |
| It does not use Dependency Injection.         | It support Dependency Injection.                                                  |

2. ### What Is Angular?

Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.

3. ### What is TypeScript and why it is used?

TypeScript is a programming language first developed by Microsoft in 2012. Its main ambition is to improve the productivity of developing complex applications.
It is an open-source language developed as a superset of JavaScript. What this means in simple terms is that any code valid in JavaScript is also valuable for TypeScript.

### Example

**Without typescript**

```js
var x = 1
var y = 2
```

**With typescript**

```ts
var x: number = 1
var y: number = 2
```

4. ### Why Angular?

JavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not. These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own.
