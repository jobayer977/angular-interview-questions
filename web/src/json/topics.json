{"1. Why Angular?":[{"title":"Why Angular?","content":"\nJavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not. These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own.\n\nAngular Provide a collection of integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including: routing forms management client server communication and more. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible so take advantage of the latest features development tools and libraries.\n","section":"1.

What are the directive":[{"title":"What are the directives ?","content":"\nDirectives are classes that add new behavior or modify the existing behavior to the elements in the template. Basically directives are used to manipulate the DOM, for example adding/removing the element from DOM or changing the appearance of the DOM elements.\n\n**Example of Angular directive**\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'my-app',\n\ttemplate: `\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li *ngFor=\"let name of names\">\n\t\t\t\t{{ name }}\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t`,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\tnames: string[]\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.names = ['John', 'Mary', 'Mike']\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this above code, the `*ngFor` directive is used to iterate over the names array and display the names in the template.\n","section":"10.

What are the order of angular lifecycle hooks execution":[{"title":"What are the order of angular lifecycle hooks execution ?","content":"\nAngular gives us 8 hooks to allow us to tap into the lifecycle of our components and trigger actions at specific points in the lifecycle.\n\nHere are the lifecycle hooks available , in the order which they are invoked:\n\n1. ngOnChanges\n2. ngOnInit\n3. ngDoCheck\n4. ngAfterContentInit\n5. ngAfterContentChecked\n6. ngAfterViewInit\n7. ngAfterViewChecked\n8. ngOnDestroy\n\n**ngOnChanges** Called every time a data-bound input property changes. It’s called a first time before the ngOnInit hook. The hook receives a SimpleChanges object that contains the previous and current values for the data-bound inputs properties. This hook gets called often, so it’s a good idea to limit the amount of processing it does.\n\n**ngOnInit** Called once upon initialization of the component.\n\n**ngDoCheck** Use this hook instead of ngOnChanges for changes that Angular doesn’t detect. It gets called at every change detection cycle, so keeping what it does to a minimum is important for performance.\n\n**ngAfterContentInit** Called after content is projected in the component.\n\n**ngAfterContentChecked** Called after the projected content is checked.\n\n**ngAfterViewInit** Called after a component’s view or child view is initialized.\n\n**ngAfterViewChecked** Called after a component’s view or child view is checked.\n\n**ngOnDestroy** Called once when the component is destroyed and a good hook to use to cleanup and unsubscribe from observables.\n","section":"11.

To have a view of all these occurrences and respond to these moments, Angular provides lifecycle hooks that give us visibility into these. These lifecycle hooks can be implemented by the interfaces provided in the Angular Core Library. This is the same with components and directives. Every interface contains different lifecycle hook methods, named with the interface name prefixed with ng.

If we directly navigate to the child route, the canActivate guard will also be executed.\n\n- canActivateChild will always be executed while navigating to/between child routes. For example, if we're at a child route child/1 and we navigate to child/2, the guard will get executed. If we directly navigate to a child route, the guard will also get called. If we navigate to the parent route, the canActivateChild guard will not be fired.\n\n- because canActivate is guarding the parent route, the child parameters (and data) are not available on the ActivatedRouteSnapshot of the canActivate guard. To be able to access the child parameters, we have to drill down the child components on the RouterStateSnapshot.\n","section":"50.
