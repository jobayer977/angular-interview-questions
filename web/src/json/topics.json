{"1. Why Angular?":[{"title":"Why Angular?","content":"\nJavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not. These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own.\n\nAngular Provide a collection of integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including: routing forms management client server communication and more. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible so take advantage of the latest features development tools and libraries.\n","section":"1.

What are the directive":[{"title":"What are the directives ?","content":"\nDirectives are classes that add new behavior or modify the existing behavior to the elements in the template. Basically directives are used to manipulate the DOM, for example adding/removing the element from DOM or changing the appearance of the DOM elements.\n\n**Example of Angular directive**\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'my-app',\n\ttemplate: `\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li *ngFor=\"let name of names\">\n\t\t\t\t{{ name }}\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t`,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\tnames: string[]\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis.names = ['John', 'Mary', 'Mike']\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this above code, the `*ngFor` directive is used to iterate over the names array and display the names in the template.\n","section":"10.

What is TypeScript and why it is used?":[{"title":"What is TypeScript and why it is used?","content":"\nTypeScript is a programming language first developed by Microsoft in 2012. Its main ambition is to improve the productivity of developing complex applications.\nIt is an open-source language developed as a superset of JavaScript. What this means in simple terms is that any code valid in JavaScript is also valuable for TypeScript.\n\n### Example\n\n**Without typescript**\n\n```js\nvar x = 1\nvar y = 2\n```\n\n**With typescript**\n\n```ts\nvar x: number = 1\nvar y: number = 2\n```\n","section":"2.

What is Components?":[{"title":"What is Components?","content":"\nIn Angular, Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. Unlike other directives, only one component can be instantiated for a given element in a template.\n\n- Components are typically custom HTML elements, and each of these elements can instantiate only one component.\n- A TypeScript class is used to create a component. This class is then decorated with the `@Component` decorator. The decorator accepts a metadata object that gives information about the component.\n- A component must belong to the NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application.\n- Components control their runtime behavior by implementing Life-Cycle hooks.\n\n**Example of an Component**\n\n```TypeScript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'Angular';\n}\n```\n","section":"3.

What are templates in Angular":[{"title":"What are templates in Angular","content":"\nIn Angular, templates are the HTML that is used to render the application. It's responsible for the layout and content and how it is displayed in the UI. Every component has an HTML template that declares how that component renders. You define this template either inline or by file path. Angular extends HTML with additional syntax that lets you insert dynamic values from your component. Angular automatically updates the rendered DOM when your component's state changes.\n\n**Example of a angular template**\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'my-app',\n\ttemplate: `\n\t\t<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>\n\t\t<p>This is some content</p>\n\t`,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\tname = 'Angular'\n}\n```\n\nHere name is a property that is bound to the {{ name }} in the template. It's an syntax that is used to insert dynamic values into the template.\n","section":"7. What are templates in Angular","source":"https://angular.io"}],"8. What Is property binding in angular":[{"title":"What Is property binding in angular ?","content":"\nProperty binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Use property binding to do things such as toggle button functionality, set paths programmatically, and share values between components.\n\n**Example of Angular property binding**\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n\tselector: 'my-app',\n\ttemplate: ` <img [src]=\"imageUrl\" /> `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n\timageUrl = 'https://picsum.photos/200/300'\n}\n```\n\nThe above code creates an Angular component that displays an image. The image's source is set to the value of the imageUrl property in the DOM node. A target property is the property of the DOM node that is set to the value of the imageUrl property.\n","section":"8.

What is the difference between properties and attributes in HTML?":[{"title":"What is the difference between properties and attributes in HTML?","content":"\nWhen writing HTML source code, you can define attributes on your HTML elements. Then, once the browser parses your code, a corresponding DOM node will be created. This node is an object, and therefore it has properties.\n\nFor instance, this HTML element:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n```\n\nHas 2 attributes `(type and value)`.\nOnce the browser parses this code, a HTMLInputElement object will be created, and this object will contain dozens of properties like: accept, accessKey, align, alt, attributes, autofocus, baseURI, checked, childElementCount, childNodes, children, classList, className, clientHeight, etc.\n","section":"9.
