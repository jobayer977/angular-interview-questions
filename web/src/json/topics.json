Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.\n","section":"What Is Angular?","source":"https://www.simplilearn.com/"}],"What is TypeScript and why it is used?":[{"title":"What is TypeScript and why it is used?","content":"\nTypeScript is a programming language first developed by Microsoft in 2012. Its main ambition is to improve the productivity of developing complex applications.\nIt is an open-source language developed as a superset of JavaScript. What this means in simple terms is that any code valid in JavaScript is also valuable for TypeScript.\n\n### Example\n\n**Without typescript**\n\n```js\nvar x = 1\nvar y = 2\n```\n\n**With typescript**\n\n```ts\nvar x: number = 1\nvar y: number = 2\n```\n","section":"What is TypeScript and why it is used?","source":"https://www.codemotion.com/"}],"Why Angular?":[{"title":"Why Angular?","content":"\nJavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not. These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own.\n","section":"Why Angular?","source":"https://www.simplilearn.com/"}]}
